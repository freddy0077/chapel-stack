## üéØ Current Implementation

### Frontend Features ‚úÖ

- **Dual Member Linking**: Both groom and bride can be linked to member records
- **Flexible Input**: SearchableMemberOrTextInput supports member search + manual entry
- **Smart Validation**: Ensures both groom and bride information is provided
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear distinction between member-linked vs manual entries
- **Gender-Aware Logic**: Auto-populates appropriate fields based on member gender
- **Backend Compatible**: Works with current text-based schema

### Current Backend Schema

```prisma
model SacramentalRecord {
  id                    String        @id @default(cuid())
  memberId              String        // Primary member (required)
  sacramentType         SacramentType // MATRIMONY
  dateOfSacrament       DateTime
  locationOfSacrament   String
  officiantName         String
  officiantId           String?       // Optional officiant reference

  // Marriage-specific fields (current)
  groomName             String?       // Text only
  brideName             String?       // Text only
  witness1Name          String?
  witness2Name          String?

  // Certificate & metadata
  certificateNumber     String?
  certificateUrl        String?
  notes                 String?

  branchId              String
  organisationId        String?
  createdAt             DateTime      @default(now())
  updatedAt             DateTime      @updatedAt
}
```

## üèÜ Best Practices

### 1. **Member Relationship Management**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ GOOD: Link both partners when possible
const marriageRecord = {
  memberId: primaryMember.id, // One spouse (required)
  groomMemberId: groomMember?.id, // Link if member
  brideMemberId: brideMember?.id, // Link if member
  groomName: groomMember?.fullName || manualGroomName,
  brideName: brideMember?.fullName || manualBrideName,
};

// ‚ùå AVOID: Only linking one partner
const marriageRecord = {
  memberId: oneMember.id,
  groomName: "Manual text only", // Lost relationship data
  brideName: "Manual text only",
};
```

### 2. **Data Validation Hierarchy**

```typescript
// Priority order for marriage record validation:
1. Both partners are church members ‚Üí Link both
2. One partner is member ‚Üí Link member, manual entry for other
3. Neither are members ‚Üí Manual entry for both (rare case)
4. Validate all required fields regardless of member status
```

### 3. **User Experience Flow**

```
1. Select primary member (groom or bride)
2. Auto-populate their field based on gender
3. Search/select or manually enter other partner
4. Validate witness information
5. Complete officiant and ceremony details
6. Generate certificate with proper member references
```

## üîß Backend Improvements

### Priority 1: Enhanced Schema Design

#### Recommended Schema Enhancement

```prisma
model SacramentalRecord {
  id                    String        @id @default(cuid())

  // Core sacrament info
  sacramentType         SacramentType
  dateOfSacrament       DateTime

  // Primary member (required - one of the spouses)
  memberId              String
  member                Member        @relation("PrimarySacramentMember", fields: [memberId], references: [id])

  // Marriage-specific member relationships
  groomMemberId         String?       // NEW: Optional groom member reference
  groomMember           Member?       @relation("GroomSacraments", fields: [groomMemberId], references: [id])

  @@index([groomMemberId])
  @@index([brideMemberId])
  @@index([dateOfSacrament])
  @@index([sacramentType, branchId])
}

// Update Member model to include marriage relationships
model Member {
  // ... existing fields ...

  // Sacrament relationships
  primarySacraments     SacramentalRecord[] @relation("PrimarySacramentMember")
  groomSacraments       SacramentalRecord[] @relation("GroomSacraments")

  witness1Sacraments    SacramentalRecord[] @relation("Witness1Sacraments")
  witness2Sacraments    SacramentalRecord[] @relation("Witness2Sacraments")
}
```

### Priority 2: Enhanced GraphQL Schema

#### Input Types

```graphql
input CreateMarriageRecordInput {
  # Core fields
  dateOfSacrament: DateTime!
  locationOfSacrament: String!

  # Member relationships
  memberId: ID! # Primary member (required)
  groomMemberId: ID # Optional groom member reference
  groomName: String! # Required display name

}
```

#### Query Types

```graphql
type MarriageRecord {
  id: ID!
  dateOfSacrament: DateTime!
  locationOfSacrament: String!

  # Member relationships with full data
  member: Member! # Primary member
  groomMember: Member # Groom if member

  # Certificate & metadata
  certificateNumber: String
  certificateUrl: String
  notes: String

  # System fields
  branch: Branch!
  organisation: Organisation
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}

# Enhanced queries for marriage analytics
type Query {
  marriageRecords(
    branchId: ID!
    dateRange: DateRangeInput
    memberIds: [ID!]
    pagination: PaginationInput
  ): PaginatedMarriageRecords!

  marriageAnalytics(
    branchId: ID!
    dateRange: DateRangeInput
  ): MarriageAnalytics!

  memberMarriageHistory(memberId: ID!): [MarriageRecord!]!
}

type MarriageAnalytics {
  totalMarriages: Int!
  memberMarriages: Int! # Both spouses are members
  mixedMarriages: Int! # One spouse is member
  externalMarriages: Int! # Neither spouse is member
  monthlyTrends: [MonthlyMarriageData!]!
  topOfficiants: [OfficiantStats!]!
}
```

### Priority 3: Backend Service Enhancements

#### Marriage Service Methods

```typescript
class MarriageService {
  // Enhanced creation with member relationship logic
  async createMarriageRecord(
    input: CreateMarriageRecordInput,
  ): Promise<MarriageRecord> {
    // 1. Validate member relationships
    // 2. Auto-detect groom/bride member IDs if not provided
    // 3. Validate business rules (no duplicate marriages, etc.)
    // 4. Create record with proper relationships
    // 5. Generate certificate
    // 6. Send notifications
  }

  // Member relationship queries
  async getMarriagesByMember(memberId: string): Promise<MarriageRecord[]>;
  async getMemberSpouse(memberId: string): Promise<Member | null>;
  async getMarriageAnalytics(
    branchId: string,
    dateRange: DateRange,
  ): Promise<MarriageAnalytics>;

  // Certificate management
  async generateMarriageCertificate(marriageId: string): Promise<string>;
  async updateCertificateUrl(marriageId: string, url: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

## üé® Frontend Enhancements

### Priority 1: Enhanced Marriage Form Component

#### Recommended Component Structure

```typescript
// MarriageRecordForm.tsx - Specialized marriage form
interface MarriageFormData {
  // Member relationships
  primaryMember: Member | null;
  groomMember: Member | null;
  groomName: string;
  brideMember: Member | null;
  brideName: string;

  // Ceremony details
  dateOfSacrament: string;
  locationOfSacrament: string;

  // Officiant
  officiantMember: Member | null;
  officiantName: string;

  // Witnesses
  witness1Member: Member | null;
  witness1Name: string;
  witness2Member: Member | null;
  witness2Name: string;

  // Certificate & notes
  certificateNumber: string;
  notes: string;
}

// Smart validation logic
const validateMarriageForm = (data: MarriageFormData): ValidationResult => {
  // 1. Ensure both groom and bride information is provided
  // 2. Validate date is not in future (unless pre-marriage counseling)
  // 3. Check for duplicate marriage records
  // 4. Validate officiant authorization
  // 5. Ensure witness requirements are met
};
```

### Priority 2: Marriage Analytics Dashboard

#### Marriage Statistics Component

```typescript
// MarriageAnalytics.tsx
interface MarriageStats {
  totalMarriages: number;
  memberMarriages: number; // Both spouses are members
  mixedMarriages: number; // One spouse is member
  externalMarriages: number; // Neither spouse is member
  averageAge: number;
  monthlyTrends: MonthlyData[];
  topOfficiants: OfficiantData[];
}

// Marriage relationship visualization
const MarriageNetworkView = () => {
  // Visual representation of member marriage relationships
  // Useful for genealogy and family tree features
};
```

### Priority 3: Certificate Management

#### Digital Certificate System

```typescript
// MarriageCertificate.tsx
interface CertificateData {
  marriageRecord: MarriageRecord;
  template: CertificateTemplate;
  signatures: DigitalSignature[];
  qrCode: string; // For verification
  watermark: string; // For authenticity
}

// Certificate generation and management
const CertificateManager = {
  generateCertificate: (marriageId: string) => Promise<string>,
  downloadCertificate: (marriageId: string, format: "PDF" | "PNG") =>
    Promise<Blob>,
  verifyCertificate: (qrCode: string) => Promise<VerificationResult>,
  emailCertificate: (marriageId: string, recipients: string[]) => Promise<void>,
};
```

## üìä Data Model Recommendations

### 1. **Member Relationship Tracking**

```typescript
// Enhanced member relationships for marriage context
interface MemberMarriageProfile {
  memberId: string;
  currentSpouse?: Member;
  marriageHistory: MarriageRecord[];
  marriageStatus: "SINGLE" | "MARRIED" | "WIDOWED" | "DIVORCED";
  marriageDate?: Date;
  anniversaryDate?: Date;
}
```

### 2. **Marriage Business Rules**

```typescript
// Business logic validation
const MarriageBusinessRules = {
  // Prevent duplicate active marriages
  validateUniqueMarriage: (groomId: string, brideId: string) => boolean,

  // Age validation (configurable by organization)
  validateMarriageAge: (member: Member, marriageDate: Date) => boolean,

  // Officiant authorization validation
  validateOfficiantAuthorization: (officiantId: string, branchId: string) =>
    boolean,

  // Pre-marriage requirements (counseling, etc.)
  validatePreMarriageRequirements: (groomId: string, brideId: string) =>
    boolean,
};
```

### 3. **Certificate Template System**

```typescript
// Configurable certificate templates
interface CertificateTemplate {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  organizationId: string;
  template: string; // HTML template
  fields: TemplateField[]; // Dynamic field mapping
  signatures: SignatureField[]; // Required signatures
  watermark?: string;
  isDefault: boolean;
}
```

## ‚ö° Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization

```typescript
// Efficient queries for marriage data
const optimizedMarriageQueries = {
  // Use proper indexing
  marriagesByDateRange: `SELECT * FROM SacramentalRecord 
                        WHERE sacramentType = 'MATRIMONY' 
                        AND dateOfSacrament BETWEEN ? AND ?
                        INDEX(dateOfSacrament_sacramentType)`,

  // Batch member relationship loading
  memberMarriageData: `SELECT sr.*, gm.*, bm.* 
                      FROM SacramentalRecord sr
                      LEFT JOIN Member gm ON sr.groomMemberId = gm.id
                      LEFT JOIN Member bm ON sr.brideMemberId = bm.id
                      WHERE sr.id IN (?)`,
};
```

### Data Migration Strategy

```sql
-- Migration script for existing marriage records
-- Step 1: Add new columns
ALTER TABLE SacramentalRecord
ADD COLUMN groomMemberId VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN brideMemberId VARCHAR(255);

-- Step 2: Attempt to match existing names to members
UPDATE SacramentalRecord sr
SET groomMemberId = (
  SELECT m.id FROM Member m
  WHERE CONCAT(m.firstName, ' ', m.lastName) = sr.groomName
  LIMIT 1
)
WHERE sr.sacramentType = 'MATRIMONY' AND sr.groomName IS NOT NULL;

-- Step 3: Add indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_sacramental_groom_member ON SacramentalRecord(groomMemberId);
CREATE INDEX idx_sacramental_bride_member ON SacramentalRecord(brideMemberId);
```

### Security Considerations

```typescript
// Marriage record access control
const MarriageSecurityRules = {
  // Only authorized personnel can create marriage records
  canCreateMarriage: (user: User) =>
    user.hasRole(["PASTOR", "MARRIAGE_OFFICIANT", "ADMIN"]),

  // Members can view their own marriage records
  canViewMarriage: (user: User, marriageRecord: MarriageRecord) =>
    user.hasRole(["ADMIN"]) ||
    marriageRecord.groomMemberId === user.memberId ||
    marriageRecord.brideMemberId === user.memberId,

  // Certificate access control
  canAccessCertificate: (user: User, marriageRecord: MarriageRecord) =>
    MarriageSecurityRules.canViewMarriage(user, marriageRecord),
};
```

## üìà Success Metrics
